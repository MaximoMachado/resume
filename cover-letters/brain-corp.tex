Dear Recruiter,
I am currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I want to express my interest in the embedded software engineer intern position at Samsung Semiconductor. I admire Samsungâ€™s dedication to building quality and cutting-edge products. For the past three years I have used a Samsung S8 and when I needed to expand the storage for my laptop, I immediately bought a Samsung SSD. I would love to be able to have the opportunity to work at the company and help build some of the products that I have made great use of and enjoy day to day.

This fall I took a class called Computation Structures that dives into the internal workings of a computer and specifically used RISC-V as the architecture to study. My favorite part of the class was the final project in which I designed a processor and quicksort algorithm in RISC-V assembly that was optimized for specific benchmarks. The interplay between writing software that takes advantage of specific design decisions of the processor I created using an in-house hardware description language was an incredibly satisfying experience. This class made me realize that I wanted to program on a level that was much more tightly entwined with the computer hardware being used and as such Embedded Systems seemed like the perfect field to dive into.

Because of this, I am starting to take strides towards becoming more experienced in the field and learning the necessary skills. This spring I will be taking an introduction class to embedded systems but, to get a head start, I am spending some time in January to learn C and C++. I have also recently acquired a Raspberry Pi so I can start working on personal projects related to the field.

I believe that I would be a great fit for this position and I hope that we are able to talk more about the internship and my qualifications. The best place to contact me would be my school email, maximo@mit.edu. I hope you have a wonderful day and I look forward to speaking with you soon!
Sincerely,
Maximo Machado
