    \opening{Dear Recruiter,}
    I am currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
    I want to express my interest in the software engineer robotics intern position at Brain Corp.
    I greatly respect the company's value for safety. With technology that is this cutting edge, it's important that the right measures are put in place to prevent any accidents.
    I would love to be able to contribute to a company which is advancing what is thought to be possible while also taking careful consideration of the effects of this advancement.
    % TODO Finish intro paragraph

    This fall I took a class called Computation Structures that dives into the internal workings of a computer and specifically used RISC-V as the architecture to study.
    My favorite part of the class was the final project in which I designed a processor and quicksort algorithm in RISC-V assembly that was optimized for specific benchmarks.
    The interplay between writing software that takes advantage of specific design decisions of the processor I created using an in-house hardware description language was an incredibly satisfying experience.
    This class made me realize that I wanted to program on a level that was much more tightly entwined with the computer hardware being used and as such robotics seems like a great field to dive into.

    Because of this, I am starting to take strides towards becoming more experienced in the field and learning the necessary skills.
    This spring I will be taking an introduction class to embedded systems but, to get a head start, I took a class this January teaching C and C++.
    I have also recently acquired a Raspberry Pi so I can start working on personal projects related to the field.

    I believe that I would be a great fit for this position and I hope that we are able to talk more about the internship and my qualifications.
    The best place to contact me would be my school email, maximo@mit.edu. I hope you have a wonderful day and I look forward to speaking with you soon!
    \closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
